Let’s learn more about Bear and some of its best features. If you need to start from the beginning, head back to [[Welcome to Bear]] or skip to [[Bear Pro with sync, lock, export, and themes]] and [[Tips & Tricks]].

## Work Anywhere ☁️
Your notes are automatically saved on your device as you write; that’s why there’s no save button. 😄 

If you want to sync notes between your Mac, iPad, and iPhone, [upgrade to Bear Pro](bear://x-callback-url/open-bear-pro). It offers a variety of features, and Bear will use your iCloud account to update your notes across all your devices.

Bear also supports [Apple’s Handoff technology](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681) between your iPad, iPhone, and Mac. This lets you start a note on one device, quickly switch to another, and keep writing.

## Tags and Sub-Tags 🏷
One of Bear’s most powerful features is *Tags*, a tool for organizing notes. 

When you add a word with a pound sign to a note—like #welcome —Bear treats that as a kind of folder or category for collecting all notes with that same tag. All tags appear in the Sidebar, the left-most panel of Bear.

Tags are a great way to group multiple notes of ideas, for a project, by topic, or in any way you can imagine.

Here are a few tips and tricks for tags:

* You can add as many tags as you want to each note, and they’re created on the fly
* Create [multi-word tags](https://blog.bear-writer.com/organize-notes-with-tags-and-infinite-nested-tags-c42b02b2c0d7) by surrounding them with pound signs. Example: `#Star Wars# #Home Improvement# #World Domination#`
* You can add tags anywhere in the body of a note (but not headings)—at the beginning, end, after each paragraph. It’s entirely up to you
* Select and drag one or more notes onto a tag in the Sidebar to quickly apply that tag to all of them

See [[Welcome to Bear]] to learn more about Bear’s layout and other core features.

### But wait, there’s more! 
Bear can also group related tags together as sub-tags. For example: say you add a note with the tag #welcome/organize . The /organize/ tag in the Sidebar will become a sub-tag of /welcome/!

Sub-tags work like sub-folders in the Sidebar. Tap or click the close/open button next to them, and you'll see their related sub-tags. This gives you even more organizational power with tags in Bear, and we encourage you to give them a try for your workflow.

## Publish Everywhere 🌐
When it’s time to send your notes to other apps, a friend, or the world, click the *Info Panel* ⓘ button in the upper right of a note. It has a variety of flexible export options.

The free version of Bear can export notes to Plain Text, Markdown, [TextBundle](http://textbundle.org/), Rich Text, and [TaskPaper](https://www.taskpaper.com).

A [Bear Pro subscription](bear://x-callback-url/open-bear-pro) enables more formats including PDF, HTML, Word (DOCX), and even JPG to create an image of your note. Exporting a Bear note to JPG is handy for posting on social media and other places that have limited character counts.

## The Details 🔍
In the Info Panel you can also find *word count tools* including characters, paragraphs, and an estimated *Read Time*.
