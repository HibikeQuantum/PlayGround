# Tips & Tricks
We’ve built all sorts of useful features into Bear to help you turn ideas into notes as fast as possible. Read on to step up your Bear game.

But if you want to start from the beginning, head over to [[Welcome to Bear]], learn how to [[Organize and Publish]] your notes, and check out [[Bear Pro with sync, lock, export, and themes]].

## Advanced Search 🔎
Bear can quickly search all your notes. It also has a variety of [advanced search operators](http://www.bear-writer.com/faq//Advanced%20search%20options%20in%20Bear/) that focus on certain types of content in your notes.

For example, type `@todo` in the search box to find all notes with tasks, or `@files` to find all notes with attachments. Use `@images` to find _just_ those kinds of attachments. To search specific phrases, wrap the phrase in quotes like  `"bear is cool"`. 

## Browser and App Extensions 🧩
It’s easy to collect text, images, attachments, and entire web pages from other apps. Learn how to add and use Bear’s extensions for [iPad, iPhone](http://www.bear-writer.com/faq//Extensions/iOS%20App%20Extension/), and [Mac](http://www.bear-writer.com/faq//Extensions/Browser%20extensions/).

## Tap Your Tags 🏷
All tags in Bear are tappable and clickable. To give it a try, make sure you aren’t editing a note by pressing Command + Return with a keyboard, or swiping to hide the keyboard on iOS.

Then, in any note, tap a tag like #welcome/pro tag—the Notes List will appear and show you all notes which contain that tag.

On Mac, you can hide the Sidebar and/or Notes List to enjoy distraction-free writing (on iOS, this happens automatically 😉). Use the Layout Selector (the bottom right icon) to see your options.

## Link notes together ⛓
You can link notes together in Bear. This is great for moving between multiple notes in a project, creating a choose-your-own adventure, or using multiple notes to welcome users to a red, fuzzy new app! 😉

To link one note in another:

* Anywhere in a note, type two brackets like this: *[[*
* Type a couple letters of the note you want to link
* A Suggestion Box will appear with notes to suggest
* Select one of the suggested notes, and Bear will insert the note’s name, a link, and two final brackets in your current note

*Tip* - If you’re using a keyboard with a Mac or iPad, you can use the arrow keys and Return to select a suggested note.

*Tip 2* - Note links are live. If you change the title of a linked note, the link will still work.
